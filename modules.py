"""
If you quit from the Python interpreter and
enter it again, the defintions you have made
(functions and variables) are lost. Therefore,
if you want to write a soemwhat longer program,
you aree better off using a text editor
to prepare the input for the interpreter and
running it with that file as input instead.
This is known as creating a script. As your
program gets longer, you may want to split it
into several files for eaisier maintenance.
You may also want to use a handy function
that you've written in several programs
without coying its definition into
each program.
