# automate_boring_stuff_with_python

This repository is based on the book "Automate the boring stuff with Python by Al Sweigart". I'm preparing for a new job and I decided to brush up the Python concepts. This book was on my list for a long time but I didn't get to read this book till. Finally, I have embarked on this journey and I thought to create a GitHub repo and share the code that I get to learn throughout this journey. I will be starting from the basics and then go to advaced concepts followed by some projects. Voila, if you're reading this and interested in Python, pull up yours socks and let's automate the boring stuff with Python.
